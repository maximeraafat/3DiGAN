# Generated Textured Avatars

We explore existing approaches of both generative 3D modelling and 2D image synthesis, with the goal of developing a method that will allow generation of synthetic appearances of humans. As a starting point, we experiment with recent state-of-the-art image generation methods applied to texture maps of human 3D models.

We use the HUMBI dataset for training : https://www.humbi-data.net
